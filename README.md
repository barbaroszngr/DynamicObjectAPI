# DynamicObjectAPI

## Overview

DynamicObjectAPI is a backend system that stores various objects (like products, orders, customers, etc.) in a single flexible table and manages them through a central gateway for all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This innovative project provides a powerful API, enabling users to easily create new objects and manage complex transactions involving multiple related objects efficiently.

## Key Features 

### 1. Dynamic Object Creation
Users can easily create new objects (like orders and order products) and fields through API requests. All objects are stored in a single central table, so thereâ€™s no need to create separate physical tables. The structure and fields of each object are flexible and change based on the object type (e.g., products, customers).
